\description{
Draw the graph of cash flow in order to facilitate the study and the effects of the analysis of a certain application.

Cash flow is a mathematical concept that can be plotted in order to facilitate the study and the effects of the analysis of a certain

application, which may be an investment loan, finance, etc.

Normally a cash flow contains inputs and outputs of capital, marked in

the timeline starting at t = 0.

A typical example is the graph that represents a bank loan held by a form

of business that shall return this loan in n equal installments over

the following months.

E1 E2 E3 ... En-1 En

^

I

0 1 2 3 ... n-1 n

I I I

V V V

S1 S2 S3 ... Sn-1 Sn

Is possible to note that the value is entered in the company's cash (cash was

positive) and S1, S2, ..., Sn are the values of the parcels will leave

the company's cash (negative).

The fact that each arrow is pointing upward (positive) or down (negative),

it is assumed by convention, and the cash flow will depend on who receives

or pays the Capital at a certain time, and:

t = 0 indicates the current day;

Ek is the capital input at a time k;

Sk is the capital output at a time k.
